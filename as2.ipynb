We recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",

    "### Question 5 (1.0 mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "- When backing-off to the unigram language model, you **must use the vanilla unigram language model that you have built in Q3**. Do not use the length-based unigram language model, or any fancy variant, or you will lose marks.\n",
    "- You should build a **standard bigram language model**; i.e. do not do anything complicated like a bidirectional bigram language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space). Complete the `bigram_guesser` method (use the second answer space). Note that the method currently only has one additional argument (`bigram_counts`), but you are free to add additional arguments."

    "This model used several methods which are introduced in both classes and assignment. Firstly, this model used trigram, bigram and unigram language model, which could used to calculate the possibility of a letter appeared next. Secondly, I used the backoff method to integrating those functions and multiple NLTK packages to improve the data processing speed. Moreover, it also used the bidirectional models to improve the performance and the result improve significantly. In terms of the smoothing function, I attempted to use it, but it decreased the accuracy of the model. Hence, I decided to discard it.\n",
